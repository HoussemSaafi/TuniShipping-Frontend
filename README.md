(We are using a free database service provider so we don't know how much time it is going to be up. In case the remote database is down once you check the code, please let us know so that we would fix the problem!)

+About Our Website: (SHORT SUMMARY) : check the website and the use case diagram for many more! Our website is a shop/shipping website which primary goal is to listen to its clients through the LIVE CHAT IMPLEMENTED and see what the majority of its clients are interested in shipping from abroad (EUROPE AND USA) then once the need is targeted, we would ship these products and expose them to our clients! From the administrator side, we receive orders and set time for their delivery and see the list of clients and respond to complaints and many other things On the other hands clients can get involved in live discussions and put comments on the products as well as buy products and choose different ways of payment:(paypall or once the order is delivered with a printed receipt!) finally a client could also follow the status of his order just to make sure that the client is well informed about his order.

+You can register or use our default Administrator to log into the backend deployed website:

email: admin@admin.com // password: admin

+You can register or use any of the accounts in the database to connect in the frontend deployed website:

+the links to our website deployed on Heroku:

BACKEND/ADMINISTRATOR SIDE: https://tunishipping-backend.herokuapp.com/

FRONTEND/CLIENTS AND NORMAL USERS SIDE: https://tunishipping-frontend.herokuapp.com/

In order to make this deployment happen we had to use other git repositories in which we had our code seperated and rearranged in order to get deployed on Heroku: Please note that this repository was the repository in which we have been working during the last few months (among other repositories). Here you would be able to see our different commits. The other two repositories don't show every team member part of the project!
